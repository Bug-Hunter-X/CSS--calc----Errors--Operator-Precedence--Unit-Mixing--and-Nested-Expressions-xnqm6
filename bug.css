The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes cause unexpected results due to incorrect operator precedence or unit mixing. For instance, using `calc(100% - 10px)` is fine, but combining different units without explicit multiplication can lead to errors.  Another issue arises when using `calc()` within nested expressions; ensuring correct parentheses placement is crucial.  Furthermore, browser compatibility issues with older versions might exist.
